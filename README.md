# ArOIE
Information Extraction from unstructured text has been a big problem in natural language processing , text mining research field ,
Open Information Extraction (Open IE) is a paradigm that tries to extract as much information as possible, with less restriction on the information type to be extracted.
It extracts relation tuples, in which a relation tuple consists of a relation tuple trigger and several relation arguments.
Previous studies on developing Open IE systems have mainly been for English. Although Arabic language is a major language.
our paper is intended to fill this knowledge gap and present Arabic OIE. 
Recently, several works have also been carried out in other languages, 
but there is no significant research or development to the best of our knowledge no has been conducted in Arabic OIE yet. 
In this paper, we investigate several rule-based methods for building an Open IE system for Arabic. 
We use lexical and syntactic features that were obtained from an Arabic language processing tool and compare the extraction results against the standard English Open IE systems. 
At the same time, the dependency relation-based performance depends on the dependency parser performance,
which still needs improvement since we use a small size dataset on training the parser.
An experimental study is performed on a dataset consisted from 62 Arabic sample sentences in total covers four domains,
showing a good effectiveness of the systems in determining correct clause types and extracting coherent proposition.
